## Day 4 Questions

1. In your own words, what is the purpose of a function?

A function is a code block that when called on it is run to do a specific task. It is like a cubby inside of the code that when you need a particular action done, it will do it and can be ran as many times as desired. It is a way to organize your code by grouping statements together that are required to answer a question or perform a task.

2. What is a parameter?

Inside of a function the parameter(s) act like variable names and used like variables.

3. What is a return value?

This is the result when a function is called on by code. Given by the *return* keyword.

4. In the space below, declare a function named `hello` that will print to the console, `"Sam I am"`.

function hello() {
  console.log("Sam I am");
};

hello();

5. Declare a function name `helloSomeone` that takes an argument of `name` and logs `name + " I am"`.

function helloSomeone(name) {
  console.log(name + " I am");
